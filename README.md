# Phase 1 Project Templates and Examples

This repo contains templates and examples to help you get started with your Phase 1 Project. Each of these is in a separate branch as explained below.

- The **template-mvp** branch is the template you should use to for your Phase 1 Project. MVP stands for Minimum Viable Product, but this isn't meant in a negative way - if your project uses this template, it will be functional and accessible.

- The **example-mvp** branch is an example project using the MVP template.

Once you've completed your project using the MVP template, you can improve it using the Above and Beyond (AAB) template if you have time:

- The **template-aab** branch is the AAB template to use to keep improving your project.

- The **example-aab** branch is an example project using the AAB template.
